# microservice361

This is a microservice that uses HTTP request/response as a communication pipe in order to send a baking meme from the server to the client.  Here is a UML diagram to summarize how it works:

The server is found in the file called "server.js."  It is intended to run locally on Port8000.  First, it randomly selection between 5 files (feel free to use your own baking meme files) and reads said file (in this case, the file is a jpeg image that is a baking meme).  Then the file is hosted on the server at Port8000. 

The client in this case is a HTTP request in "client.js".  It sends a GET HTTP request to Port8000.  When it receives a response, it saves the data in the response to a file called "img.jpg."  In this example, the file is saved in the same folder, and it can then be accessed by a web app to be post the picture to the web app.  

An example of the client request can be found in teh "client.js" file but is essentially looks like this:

Once the server is running, the GET request will contact the server at Port8000 and receive the image as a response.  It will then save the image - in this example, the image is saved in the same folder- and the image is available to use in a web app.
